In the Fall of 2016, I served as one of the instructors for a section of Cornell’s MATH 1300 *“Mathematical Explorations”* which was taught at Cayuga Correctional Facility via Cornell Prison education Program. I’ve also worked in the past as a tutor in Auburn Correctional Facility, and I’ve collaborated as an adviser to the Mathematics Committee. You can learn more about CPEP [here](http://cpep.cornell.edu/).

Before that, I’ve held positions as a teaching assistant both at Cornell University (Multivariate Calculus, Dynamical Systems, Totally Awesome Mathematics) as well as at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Differential Topology, Real Analysis, Differential Equations).
