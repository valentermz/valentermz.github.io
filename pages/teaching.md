As a lecturer at the UT I teach courses on statistics and mathematics. In addition, I lead tutorials for multiple courses offered by the Department of Applied Mathematics. Below is the list of courses I've been inovolved with in either role:

&nbsp;

| Course | Period | Program |
| :----- | :----- | :------ |
| Intro to Mathematics + Calculus 1A | 1A, 2020-2021 | Computer Science, Business Information Technology, Civil Engineering |
| Medische Statistiek | 1A, 2020 | Technische Geneeskunde |
| Statistics & Probability | 1A, 2020-2021 | MSc Business Information Technology, MSc Industrial Engineering and Management |
| Statistical Techniques | 1B, 2020 | Computer Science, Business Information Technology |
| Signaalanalyse | 1B, 2020 | Technische Geneeskunde |
| Linear Algebra | 2A, 2021 | Computer Science, Business Information Technology, Civil Engineering |
| Calculus 2 | 2B, 2021 | Civil Engineering, Biomedical Technology, Industrial Engineering and Management, Chemical Engineering |

In the Fall of 2016, I served as one of the instructors for a section of Cornell’s MATH 1300 *“Mathematical Explorations”* which was taught at Cayuga Correctional Facility via Cornell Prison education Program. I’ve also worked in the past as a tutor in Auburn Correctional Facility, and I’ve collaborated as an adviser to the Mathematics Committee. You can learn more about CPEP [here](http://cpep.cornell.edu/).

Before that, I’ve held positions as a teaching assistant both at Cornell University (Multivariate Calculus, Dynamical Systems, Totally Awesome Mathematics) as well as at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Differential Topology, Real Analysis, Differential Equations).
